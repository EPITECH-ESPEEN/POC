## 🌟 Project Overview

I've created this portfolio to showcase my skills and prove to myself (and to you) that I can do it! 🌈✨ It was an incredibly fun journey, from the initial mockup to the final development. In this portfolio, you'll find many details about me, including a complete presentation of my soft and technical skills, the languages I use, my hobbies, and more. You can explore a list of my projects, the libraries I've created, and even some of the poster designs I've done. 🎨👩‍💻

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

This project is built using the following technologies:

- **Vue** 🌿
- **HTML** 🖼️
- **CSS** 🎨
- **TailWindCSS** 🖌
- **TypeScript** 📝
- **JavaScript** ⚡

These are the core languages and frameworks of web development, and I was eager to develop a project using Vue. 🌟

## 🌈 CI / CD

We have a CI/CD pipeline in place to ensure the quality of the project. If you want to contribute, please follow these steps:

1. **Create a new branch**:
   ```sh
   git checkout -b your-branch-name
   ```

2. **Make your changes and commit them**:
   ```sh
   git add .
   git commit -m "Your detailed description of the changes"
   ```

3. **Push to your branch**:
   ```sh
   git push origin your-branch-name
   ```

4. **Create a pull request** against the `prod` branch.

Our CI pipeline will check if the project can be built before accepting any pull requests. This ensures that the main branch remains stable and deployable. 🚀🔧
